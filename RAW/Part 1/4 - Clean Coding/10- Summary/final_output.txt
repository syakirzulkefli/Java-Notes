# Study Notes for 10- Summary

So, in this section you'll learn about clean coding and refactoring, which is about changing
the structure of the code without changing its behavior.
As a best practice, keep your methods short, ideally between 5 to 10 lines and no more

If your method has more than 20 lines of code, it's very likely that it's doing too many
things, and you can most likely extract some parts and move them to other methods.

These are the best candidates for extracting.
In the next section we're going to talk about debugging Java applications.
So, I'll see you next.
