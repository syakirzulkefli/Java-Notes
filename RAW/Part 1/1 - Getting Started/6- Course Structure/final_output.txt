# Study Notes for 6- Course Structure

## Transcript

Now, let me give you a quick overview of how I've structured this course so you can get
the most out of it.
This course is the first part of my complete four part Java series.
Each part is about three to four hours long so you can easily complete it in a day or two.
In the first part which is what you're watching, you're going to learn the fundamentals
of programming with Java.
In the next section you'll learn about the type system in Java, you will learn how to work
with various types such as numbers, strings, booleans and arrays.
By the end of this section you will build a mortgage calculator as your first Java project.
We'll be improving this calculator bit by bit throughout this course.
Next you will learn about control flow statements that are used to build algorithms.
We'll be talking about various types of conditional statements and loops.
Later in this section we'll add data validation to our mortgage calculator to force the
user to enter valid values.
At this point you'll be able to build basic algorithms and that's great.
But being a good programmer requires knowing how to write good code, code that is clean and
expressive.
That's what separates an outstanding programmer from an average programmer.
So in the following section we'll talk about clean coding.
I will show you various techniques that professional programmers use to make their code
clean and maintainable.
Then finally in the last section you will learn how to find and fix errors in your
Java programs as well as how to package them for deployment so others can use them.
So the materials in the first part will give you a solid foundation on how to start programming
in Java.
In the second part we'll talk about object oriented programming which is a style of programming
use in most if not all Java applications.
Whether you want to use Java to build web, mobile or desktop applications you need to understand
object oriented programming well because otherwise you're going to constantly hit obstacles.
In the third part we're going to talk about core Java APIs or application programming interfaces.
You'll learn about many of the useful classes in the standard Java library.
And finally in the last part we'll be looking at the advanced features in Java such
as streams, threads, database programming and so on.
So I hope you're going to join me on this journey and master Java.
The most popular programming language behind millions of apps and websites.
