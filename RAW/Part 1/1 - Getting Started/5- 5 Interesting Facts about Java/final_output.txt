## Transcript

So you have seen Java in action. Now let me tell you 5 interesting facts about Java.
Java was developed by James Gosling in 1995 at Sun Microsystems, which was later acquired
by Oracle in 2010. It was originally called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside
Gosling's office. Later it was renamed to Green and was finally renamed to Java, inspired
by Java Coffee. That's why it's logo looks like this.
We have 4 editions of Java for building different kinds of applications. We have Java standard
edition. This is the core Java platform, which is what we're using in this course. It contains
all of the libraries that every Java developer must learn. We have Java enterprise
edition, which is used for building very large scale and distributed systems. It's built
on top of Java standard edition and provides additional libraries for building fault
tolerant, distributed, multi-tier software. We have Java micro edition, which is a
subset of Java standard edition designed for mobile devices. So it has libraries, specific
to mobile devices. And finally we have Java card, which is used in smart cards. The latest
version of Java is Java standard edition 12, which was released just a few months ago in
March 2019. Java has closed the 9 million developers worldwide. Currently about 3 billion
mobile phones run Java as well as 120 million TV sets and every blue ray player. According
to indie.com, the average salary of a Java developer is just over $100,000 per year in
the US. So as you can see, Java is everywhere, which means more opportunities for you
to get hired as a professional programmer.
