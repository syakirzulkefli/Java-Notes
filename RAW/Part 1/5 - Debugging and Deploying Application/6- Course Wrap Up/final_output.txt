# Study Notes for 6- Course Wrap Up

## Transcript

If you're reached the end of this course, thank you so much for being with me on this journey.
I hope you learned a lot and are excited to learn even more.
As I told you before, this course is the first part of my ultimate Java series.
In the next part we're going to talk about object oriented programming, which is a style of programming used in most Java applications.
It's a very important topic and often comes in job interviews.
So if you're serious about Java and want to become a Java developer, I highly encourage you to enroll in the second part of this series.
You can find the course on code with mosh.com.
Thank you so much and I hope to see you again.
