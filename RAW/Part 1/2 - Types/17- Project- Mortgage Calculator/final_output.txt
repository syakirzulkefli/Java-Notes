# Study Notes for 17- Project- Mortgage Calculator

## Transcript

Alright, now it's time for a project.
I want you to use what you have learned in a section and build a Mortgage calculator like
this.
So when we run this program we get a few questions.
The first question is the principle or the amount of loan we want to get, let's say $100,000.
The second question is the annual interest rate.
Let's say 3.92%.
And the third question is period in years.
Let's say we want to get a loan for 30 years.
So this program calculates our monthly payments and displays it as a currency.
This is a great exercise for you to practice all the materials you learn in the section.
Now, before you get started I want to give you a few hints.
Here is the formula for calculating the Mortgage or the monthly payments.
I found this page on wikihow.com it's called Calculate Mortgage Payments.
So let's see how this works.
Let's get equals P or principal or the amount we're going to loan multiplied by R which
is our monthly interest rate.
This is very important.
So this number that we get here is our annual interest rate, but if you divide this by
12.
Also taking to account that this number is represented as a percent to calculate the actual
interest rate you need to divide this number by 100.
So in this example the interest rate is 0.0392.
Whatever the user enters divided by 100 and then divided by 12 to get to the monthly
interest rate.
Now we have this monthly interest rate we need to multiply this by this expression.
Here we need to add one to this interest rate and raise it to the power of n where n is
the number of payments.
So we need to multiply this number by 12 or 12 months to calculate the number of payments.
Now to raise this number to the power of n you need to use the power method of the
math class.
So this math class has this power or power method that takes two arguments or two values,
A and B.
So go ahead and spend 10 to 15 minutes on this exercise, but you're done, come back
to see my solution.
