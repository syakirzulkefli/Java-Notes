# Study Notes for 16- Summary

## Transcript

So, in this section, you'll learn how to control the flow of execution of your programs.
You started off by talking about the comparison operators for comparing primitive values.
Then we talked about the logical operators like AND OR and NOT.
I showed you how we can use these operators for implementing real-world rules.
And then we talked about three types of control flow statements.
You'll learn about conditional statements like IF and SWITCH
for making decisions in our programs.
Then you learn about loops for executing code repetitively.
We looked at four types of loops, four loops,
Y loops, do Y loops and four each loops.
And finally we looked at the break and continuous statements for breaking
or jumping to the beginning of a loop.
I hope you learned a lot and been enjoying the course so far.
