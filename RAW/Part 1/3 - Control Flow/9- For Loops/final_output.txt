# Study Notes for 9- For Loops

## Transcript

There are times that we want to repeat one or more statements.
For example, let's say we have this hell of world message here.
Let's say we want to print this five times on the terminal.
We don't want to repeat this code like this.
This looks very ugly.
That's where we use loops.
In Java, we have a few different types of loops.
The first one that I'm going to talk about in this tutorial is four loops.
So let's see how we can use a four loop here.
I'm going to delete on this code.
We start by typing the four keyword followed by parenthesis.
And inside this parenthesis, we need to do three things.
First we need to declare a loop or a counter variable.
So let's declare a variable called i and initialize it to zero.
Quit often use variable names like i, j and k for loop counters.
Next we add a semicolon to terminate the first statement.
Then we write a Boolean expression that determines how many times this loop is going to get executed.
So i less than five.
As long as i is less than five, this loop would be executed.
Once again, we add a semicolon.
And finally we increment i by one like this.
So this is the basic structure for a four loop.
Now here we can repeat one or more statements using this four loop.
So we can add our hello world message here.
Like here we have a single statement.
So we don't need braces.
But if you have multiple statements that we want to repeat,
we need to define a code block here.
Now i'm going to remove these because we don't really need them.
So let's run this code and see what we get.
You get hello word printed five times on the terminal.
Beautiful.
Now let me explain how this code gets executed.
When Java sees this four loop, first it will execute this statement.
So here we are initializing i to zero.
Then Java evaluates this condition.
Is this condition true?
Obviously it is because zero is less than five.
So the control moves to line seven.
This line gets executed.
Now at the end of this iteration or at the end of this loop, the control moves here.
So i is incremented by one.
Now we are at the beginning of the second iteration.
Once again, this condition is evaluated.
Is one less than five obviously it is.
So once again, the body of this loop gets executed.
Now fast forward.
At the end of the fifth iteration, i will become five.
Five is not less than five.
So the loop condition will be false and control moves outside of this four loop.
Now here's one thing you need to remember.
If you want to execute something five times,
you can initialize your loop counter or loop variable to zero
and use the less than operator here.
Another way is to initialize this to one and then use the less than or equal to operator here.
Now to make this more interesting, let's print i over here.
So here we add a space and then concatenate this string with i.
Take a look.
So we get hello word one, two, three, four, five.
In contrast, if we initialize i to zero and use the less than operator,
we will get hello word zero one to three four.
We can also print this numbers in reverse order.
So we initialize i to five and execute this loop as long as i is greater than zero.
But here instead of incrementing i, we decremented.
Now we get hello word five, four, three, two, one.
So this is all about four loops.
Next we're going to look at why loops.
