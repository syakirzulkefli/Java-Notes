# Study Notes for 11- Do..While Loops

## Transcript

In Java, we have another type of loop called a do-wire loop.
It's very similar to a wire loop, but it gets executed at least once.
Let me show you what I mean.
So I'm going to rewrite the same code using a do-wire loop.
We start with a do keyword, then we create a code block.
At the end of this code block, we type while followed by our loop condition.
So not input.equalsquit.
And then we terminate this using a semicolon.
Now inside the body of the loop, we'll simply copy all these lines we have here.
Now compare these two types of loops.
With wire loops, we check the condition first.
So if the condition is false the first time, this loop will never get executed.
In contrast, we do wire loops, we check the condition last.
So do wire loops always get executed at least once.
Even if the condition is false, that is the only difference.
Now reality most of the time we use wire loops, do wire loops are rarely used, but there
are certain cases for them.
So just be aware of them, but most of the time, prefer to use wire loops.
