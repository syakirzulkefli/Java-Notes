# Study Notes for 1- Introduction

## Transcript

In this section, we're going to look at control flow or controlling the flow of execution
of our programs.
We're going to start off by talking about comparison operators for comparing values.
Then we're going to talk about logical operators, like the logical end, logical or and logical

We use these operators for implementing real-world rules.
And then we're going to talk about three different types of control flow statements.
We're going to talk about conditional statements for making decisions in our programs.
Then we're going to talk about loops for executing code repeatedly and finally we're
