# Study Notes for 14- Project- Mortgage Calculator

## Transcript

Alright, now let's get back to our mortgage calculator and implement some basic error handling.
So here I've changed this question by adding this label that identifies the range of values we can enter.
So the minimum amount of loan we can get is $1,000 and maximum is $1 million.
So if I enter one here, I get this message enter a number between $1,000 and $1 million.
And now we are asked this question more more time.
If I keep entering invalid values, I get asked the same question.
Now let's enter a valid value like $1 million.
Next we need to enter the annual interest rate.
Now here we need to enter a value that is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 30.
So if I enter 0, we get this message, enter a value greater than 0 and less than or equal to 30.
Once again we're asked this question more more time.
So let's enter a valid value like $3.92.
Here we need to enter a value between $1 and $30.
So if you enter 0, we get an error message and we're asked the same question.
So let's enter $30 and finally we get the result.
Here's our mortgage or monthly payments.
So go ahead and spend five to ten minutes on extending this mortgage calculator by adding error handling to it.
You'll see my solution next.
