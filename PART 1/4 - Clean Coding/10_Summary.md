# Study Notes for 10- Summary

## Transcript

1. So, in this section you'll learn about clean coding and refactoring, which is about changing  
   the structure of the code without changing its behavior.

2. As a best practice, keep your methods short, ideally between 5 to 10 lines and no more

7. So, I'll see you next.
