# Study Notes for 2- Comparison Operators

1. We're going to start this section by talking about comparison operators.

2. We use these operators to compare primitive values.

3. For example, are `x` and `y` equal or not?

4. So I'm going to declare two integers, `x` and `y`.

5. Now let's compare these to see if they're equal or not.

6. First, I'm going to add this print line statement.

7. Now to compare these variables we type `x == y`.

8. So here we have two equal signs—this is the equality operator.

9. Don't confuse this with the single equal sign that we use for assignment.

10. That is the operator used over here: `x = y`.

11. So two equal signs represent the equality operator.

12. Now when we run this program, we get `true` because these values are equal.

13. This expression that we have here is called a Boolean expression.

14. Earlier I told you that an expression is a piece of code that produces a value.

15. This piece of code produces a Boolean value: `true` or `false`.

16. That's why we refer to it as a Boolean expression.

17. We also have the inequality operator `!=`.

18. So when we run this program, we're going to see `false`.

19. Let's take a look—we get `false` because these two variables are equal.

20. So the expression `x != y` returns `false`.

21. We also have `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `<=`.

22. So if I change `y` to `2`, the expression `x <= y` will evaluate to `true`.

23. Take a look—there you go.

24. Next we're going to talk about logical operators.
