# Study Notes for 9- Multi-dimensional Arrays

1. So you have learned that we use arrays to store a list of objects.

2. In Java, we can also create multi-dimensional arrays.

3. For example, we can create a two-dimensional array to store a matrix.

4. Or we can create a three-dimensional array to store data for a cube.

5. These are useful in scientific computations.

6. Let me show you.

7. So here we have a single-dimensional array to convert this to a two-dimensional array.

8. We need to add another pair of square brackets.

9. Now we have a compilation error because we need to repeat these brackets on the other side.

10. So let's say we want to create a two-by-three matrix.

11. So two rows and three columns.

12. We add another brackets here and change these lengths to two and three.

13. So now we have two rows and three columns.

14. Now to access individual items and this array, we need to supply two indexes.

15. First, the index of the row.

16. So we can go to the first row and then the first column and initialize that to one.

17. Now let's print this.

18. So, and so you see tab.

19. Once again, we use our arrays class.2 string and pass this object.

20. Take a look.

21. Once again, we get this weird string because here we're dealing with a multi-dimensional array.

22. To solve this problem, we need to use another method in this class called deep two string.

23. We use this for printing multi-dimensional arrays.

24. Take a look.

25. Now we have this matrix which has two rows and in each row we have three columns.

26. We can also create a three-dimensional array.

27. All we have to do is to add another pair of brackets and specify the lengths of that dimension.

28. Pretty easy.

29. Now what about the curly breast syntax?

30. Let me show you.

31. So let's revert this back to a two-dimensional array.

32. We're going to get rid of the new operator and use curly braces.

33. Now let's say in this matrix, we're going to have two rows and three columns.

34. So each row is an array itself because it's a list of items.

35. So we add another array here.

36. Let's say one, two, three.

37. Then comma, now we add the second row which is another array.

38. In this row we're going to have three numbers, four, five, and six.

39. Now let's remove this line, we don't need it anymore.

40. And print this array.

41. So here's the end result.
