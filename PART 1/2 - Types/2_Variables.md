# Study Notes for 2 - Variables

1. In this tutorial we're going to talk about variables in Java.

2. We use variables to temporarily store data in computer's memory.

3. Here is an example. Imagine in this program you want to store someone's age in the memory.

4. So we declare a variable like this: `int age = 30;`

5. So `int` or integer is the type of this variable.

6. In this variable we can only store integers which are whole numbers—like 1, 2, 3, 4—numbers that don't have a decimal point.

7. In Java we have several different types. I'm going to talk about them in the next tutorial.

8. So first we specify the type of variable.

9. Then we give it a name or a label. This is also called an identifier because we use it to identify our variable.

10. This equals sign is called the assignment operator.

11. And `30` is the initial value that we are assigning to this variable.

12. So we say on line six, we're initializing this variable, which means we're giving it an initial value.

13. We always have to initialize our variables before reading them.

14. So with this line we're storing number 30 somewhere in computer's memory and we're assigning this label to that memory location.

15. Now on line seven instead of printing "Hello World", we can print the value of the age variable.

16. Take a look—so I'm going to run this program using Control + R.

17. There you go. Now we see `30` on the terminal. Beautiful.

18. We can also change the value of our variable. So after we initialize it, perhaps we can change it to `35`.

19. Now when we run this program again, we see `35`. Beautiful.

20. We can also initialize multiple variables on the same line.

21. But this is something that I don't recommend because it makes your code ugly and hard to read.

22. Here's an example. We can declare multiple variables like `int x = 10, y = 20;`

23. Even though this is technically possible, it's not something that I recommend.

24. So it's always better to declare one variable on each line like this.

25. We can also copy the value of one variable into another.

26. Here's an example. Let me delete these variables.

27. We can declare a new variable called `myAge` and set it to `30`.

28. Then we declare another variable like `herAge` and we set it to `myAge`.

29. So now let me print `herAge`. We're going to see `30`. Take a look.

30. So on line 7 we're copying the value of this variable into this other variable.

31. Now one thing I want you to pay attention to here is the convention I have used for naming our variables.

32. As I told you before, this is called the camelCase notation.

33. So we should capitalize the first letter of every word except the first word.

34. So in this case the first word `my` is all in lowercase, but the second word starts with the capital letter.

35. So this is all about declaring and initializing variables.

36. In the next tutorial we're going to talk about various types in Java.
